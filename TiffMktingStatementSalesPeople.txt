Title: Locate Top 10 Sales People who sold the most CDs after 6pm

We historically have had low CD sales during our evening hours.  However, during COVID, our sales have significantly have increased. I wanted to locate the top 10 Sales People who sold the most CDs during the evening hours (after 6pm).  I determined that the following to 10 Sales People are the following:

Sales Person 3 (Matthew Young) sold 12 CDs
Sales Person 5 (John Suzuki) sold 9 CDs 
Sales Person 15 (Ryan Garcia) sold 8 CDs
Sales Person 14 (Sean Li) sold 8 CDs
Sales Person 6 (Gregory Russell) sold 7 CDs
Sales Person 2 (Bonnie Coleman) sold 7 CDs
Sales Person 17 (Henry Mitchell) sold 7 CDs
Sales Person 1 (Carlos Flores) sold 7 CDs
Sales Person 11 (Joyce Watson) sold 7 CDs
Sales Person 10 (Janice Rivera) sold 6 CDs

I feel it is recommended we continue keeping these Sales People in the evening shifts to ensure our sales numbers remain high during evening hours.
